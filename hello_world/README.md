## Introduction
This project is an introduction to the C programming language. It covers the basics of writing, compiling, and running C programs. By completing the exercises in this repository, you will gain a solid foundation in C programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basic structure of a C program
- Write simple C programs
- Use the `gcc` compiler to compile C programs
- Understand and use basic C syntax and constructs

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/hello_world
```

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
Run the compiled programs:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files

- `1-compiler` - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- `2-assembler` - A script that generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file.
- `3-name` - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- `4-puts.c` - A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle".
- `5-printf.c` - A C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,".
- `6-size.c` - A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
