## Introduction
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on the fundamental concepts of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. By completing the exercises and projects in this repository, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to use functions and loops effectively in C.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basics of functions and how to use them
- Implement nested loops to solve complex problems
- Use functions to organize and modularize your code
- Understand the scope and lifetime of variables

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/functions_nested_loops
```

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
Run the compiled programs:
```sh
./<output_name>
```
