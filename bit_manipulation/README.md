# Bit Manipulation

## Overview
This project covers the concepts and implementation of bit manipulation in C programming. It includes various exercises and programs that demonstrate how to perform operations on individual bits and use bitwise operators effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basics of bit manipulation.
- Use bitwise operators such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts.
- Perform common bit manipulation tasks such as setting, clearing, and toggling bits.
- Understand the applications and advantages of bit manipulation in programming.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/bit_manipulation
```

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
Run the compiled programs:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-binary_to_uint.c` - A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- `1-print_binary.c` - A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- `2-get_bit.c` - A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- `3-set_bit.c` - A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- `4-clear_bit.c` - A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- `5-flip_bits.c` - A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
