# Singly Linked Lists

## Overview
This project covers the implementation and usage of singly linked lists in C programming. It includes various exercises and programs that demonstrate how to create, manipulate, and traverse singly linked lists.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand what a singly linked list is and how it works.
- Implement singly linked lists in C.
- Perform basic operations on singly linked lists such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Understand the advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists compared to arrays.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/singly_linked_lists
```

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
Run the compiled programs:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
- `0-print_list.c` - A function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
- `1-list_len.c` - A function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- `2-add_node.c` - A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
- `3-add_node_end.c` - A function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
- `4-free_list.c` - A function that frees a `list_t` list.
