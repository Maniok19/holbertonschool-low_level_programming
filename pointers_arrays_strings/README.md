## Introduction
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on the fundamental concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. By completing the exercises and projects in this repository, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to use these concepts effectively in C.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basics of pointers and how to use them
- Work with arrays and understand their relationship with pointers
- Manipulate strings using pointers and array notation
- Use pointers to functions and understand their applications

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/pointers_arrays_strings
```

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
Run the compiled programs:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files
