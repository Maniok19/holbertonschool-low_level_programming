## Projects
The repository is organized into several directories, each containing a specific project. Here are some of the key projects included:

- **Hello World**: Introduction to C programming, basic syntax, and compilation.
- **Variables, If, Else, While**: Basics of variables, conditional statements, and loops.
- **Functions and Nested Loops**: Understanding functions and nested loops.
- **More Functions and Nested Loops**: Advanced function usage and nested loops.
- **Pointers, Arrays, and Strings**: Working with pointers, arrays, and strings.
- **Recursion**: Implementing and understanding recursion.
- **Malloc and Free**: Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`.
- **Structures and Typedef**: Using structures and typedef in C.
- **Function Pointers**: Understanding and using function pointers.
- **Variadic Functions**: Working with functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
