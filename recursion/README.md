## Introduction
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on the fundamental concepts of recursion in the C programming language. By completing the exercises and projects in this repository, you will gain a deeper understanding of how to use recursion to solve complex problems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the basics of recursion and how to use it
- Implement recursive functions to solve problems
- Identify the base case and recursive case in a recursive function
- Understand the stack behavior in recursive function calls

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC compiler

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/recursion
```

## Usage
Compile the C files using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_name>
```
Run the compiled programs:
```sh
./<output_name>
```

## Files

- `1-print_rev_recursion.c` - A function that prints a string in reverse.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c` - A function that returns the length of a string.
- `3-factorial.c` - A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
- `4-pow_recursion.c` - A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c` - A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
- `6-is_prime_number.c` - A function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise returns `0`.
